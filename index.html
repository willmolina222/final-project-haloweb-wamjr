<h3><b>Halo Reach</b></h3>
<img src="haloreach.jpg"alt="Halo Reach"style="width: 200px;height: 200px;">
<p>
Noble Six meets the rest of Noble Team, shortly before they are dispatched to investigate 
why a communications relay has gone offline. They discover Covenant forces have invaded Reach. 
The team is relocated to defend Sword Base, an Office of Naval Intelligence (ONI) installation, 
from a Covenant assault. After repelling the attack, Noble Team meets Catherine Halsey, a scientist 
and the mastermind behind the Spartan program and their MJOLNIR powered armor. Halsey enquires about 
Noble's engagement at the relay, suspecting that the Covenant were attempting to retrieve highly
classified ONI data from the site.

Jun and Six discover an invasion force gathering on the planet. The UNSC launches an assault the next 
morning to repel the invasion. Noble Team assists the strike force, targeting key artillery stations 
and command posts. A cloaked Covenant supercarrier reveals itself; lacking a conventional weapon to 
destroy the carrier, Jorge and Six smuggle a slipspace engine onto a Covenant corvette en route to refuel 
at the carrier. With the timer damaged, and knowing that he will not make it, Jorge entrusts Six with his 
dog tags, then forces him out of the hanger of the corvette, remaining behind to detonate the engine and 
destroying the Covenant supercarrier. Another Covenant fleet arrives at Reach soon afterwards.

<img src="haloce.jpg"alt="Halo Combat Evolved"style="width: 200px;height: 200px;">
<p>
The game begins as the Pillar of Autumn exits slip-space and its crew discovers a large 
ringworld structure of unknown origin. The Covenant pursues the Autumn and attacks. With the 
ship heavily damaged, the Autumn's captain, Jacob Keyes, entrusts the ship's artificial intelligence 
(AI) known as Cortana to Master Chief in order to prevent the Covenant from discovering the location of 
Earth. 

Keyes orders the crew to abandon the Autumn and pilots the ship to a crash-landing on the ringworld.
On the ring's surface, Master Chief and Cortana rescue other survivors and help organize a counter-offensive. 
Learning that Keyes has been captured by the Covenant, Master Chief and a small contingent of soldiers rescue 
him from the Covenant cruiser Truth and Reconciliation. Keyes reveals that the Covenant call the ringworld "Halo" 
and that they believe it to be a weapon. Intent on stopping the Covenant from using Halo, Keyes searches for 
a potential weapons cache, while Master Chief and Cortana mount an assault on the ringworld's control room. 
Cortana enters Halo's computer systems and, after discovering something, sends Master Chief to find and stop 
Keyes from continuing his search.

<h3><b>Halo 2</b></h3>
<img src="halo2.jpg"alt="Halo 2"style="width: 200px;height: 200px;">
<p>Halo 2 opens with the trial of a Covenant Elite commander aboard the Covenant's 
capital city-ship of High Charity. For his failure to stop Halo's destruction, the 
Elite is stripped of his rank, branded a heretic, and tortured by Tartarus, the 
Chieftain of the Covenant Brutes. Spared execution, the Covenant leadership—the High 
Prophets Truth, Regret, and Mercy—give the Elite the chance to become an Arbiter, a 
rank given to Elites in times of great crisis or turmoil. As the Arbiter, the Elite 
quells a rebellion and recovers 343 Guilty Spark.

On Earth, Fleet Admiral Hood commends the Master Chief and Sergeant Avery Johnson 
for their actions at the first Halo, with Commander Miranda Keyes accepting a medal 
on behalf of her deceased father. A Covenant fleet suddenly appears near Earth. In 
the ensuing battle, a single ship carrying the Prophet of Regret slips through Earth's 
defenses and besieges the African city of New Mombasa. Master Chief assists in repelling 
the invasion. With his fleet destroyed, Regret makes a hasty slipspace jump, and Keyes, 
Johnson, Cortana, and the Master Chief follow aboard the UNSC ship In Amber Clad. The crew 
discovers another Halo installation; realizing the danger the ring presents, Keyes sends Master 
Chief to kill Regret while she and Johnson search for the Index, Halo's activation key.

<img src="halo3.jpg"alt="Halo 3"style="width: 200px;height: 200px;">
<p>
After the events of the comic tie-in Halo: Uprising,[20] the Master Chief arrives on Earth in east Africa, 
where he is found by Johnson and the Arbiter. The Chief and company return to a UNSC outpost where 
Keyes and Lord Hood plan a final effort to stop the Covenant leader, the High Prophet of Truth, 
from activating a Forerunner artifact the Covenant have excavated. The Chief clears anti-air Covenant 
defenses so Hood can lead the last of Earth's ships against the Prophet, but Truth activates the buried 
artifact, creating a slipspace portal which he and his followers enter. A Flood-infested ship crash-lands nearby; 
Elite forces arrive and vitrify the Flood-infected areas of Earth, stopping the threat. Following a message Cortana 
left aboard the Flood ship, the Chief, Arbiter, Elites, Johnson, Keyes and their troops follow Truth through the portal. 
Joining them is 343 Guilty Spark, who aids the Chief as he has no function to fulfill after the destruction of his ringworld.

traveling through the portal, the humans and Elites discover an immense artificial structure known as the Ark,
far beyond the edges of the Milky Way galaxy. Here, Truth can remotely activate all the Halos. The Flood arrive aboard 
High Charity in full force, beginning to infest the installation. Truth captures Johnson, as he needs a human to use Forerunner 
technology. Keyes is killed attempting a rescue, and Johnson is forced to activate the rings. Gravemind forges a truce with 
the Chief and Arbiter to stop Truth and defeat the remainder of his army, rescuing Johnson and halting the installations' 
activation. After the Arbiter kills Truth, Gravemind turns on the Chief and Arbiter.

<h3><b>Halo 3: ODST</b></h3>
<img src="halo3odst.jpg"alt="Halo 3: ODST"style="width: 200px;height: 200px;">
<p>The game begins with Dutch (Adam Baldwin), Romeo (Nolan North), and Mickey (Alan Tudyk) discussing the Covenant Supercarrier 
above New Mombasa, with the Rookie asleep nearby. Buck (Nathan Fillion) arrives and introduces Dare (Tricia Helfer). Romeo wakes 
the Rookie and the team enter their HEVs and drop through the atmosphere; at the last minute, Dare changes their trajectory to 
miss the ship due to a classified mission she has for the team.[23] The Covenant ship enters slipspace with a UNSC ship that can 
be seen pulling alongside it, sending a shockwave toward the ODSTs; the Rookie's pod collides with Mickey's and crashes into a 
building on the ground, knocking him unconscious for six hours.[24] He awakens and proceeds to find clues as to what happened to his squadmates.

Buck makes a rough landing after the drop and fights through Covenant forces to find Dare. However, Dare has vanished without 
a trace when he arrives at her drop pod, leaving behind only her helmet which is later found by the Rookie. Buck finds Romeo 
instead and the two resolve to find the others and get out of the city. Dutch drops near a nature preserve and helps Marines 
fighting there. Mickey commandeers a tank and fights his way along a Mombasa boulevard. Meeting up with Dutch, the two defend an 
ONI base from the Covenant, destroying the facility to keep it from being captured. They are evacuated by a police dropship and 
make contact with Buck, arranging a rendezvous at police headquarters, but are shot down. Buck and Romeo rescue Dutch and Mickey, 
but Romeo is seriously wounded. The squad hijacks a Covenant dropship, but instead of leaving the city, Buck decides to have them 
turn back and find Dare, having realized that Dare has continued her classified mission on her own.

<h3><b>Halo 4</b></h3>
<img src="halo4.jpg"alt="Halo 4"style="width: 200px;height: 200px;">
<p>
Chief makes contact with Infinity and helps repel the Didact's attack. Chief and Cortana recommend attacking the Didact 
while he is vulnerable, but Infinity captain Del Rio orders them to destroy the gravity well so their ship can escape. 
In the process, Chief is contacted by a Forerunner known as the Librarian—the wife of the Didact, as well as ancient humanity's 
protector. She explains that the Forerunners were divided on how best to combat the Flood. After failing to discover a way to 
immunize biological beings from the parasite, the Didact used a device called the Composer to convert the warriors under his 
command into Promethean Knights immune to infection. Requiring more soldiers, the Didact forcibly converted captured humans into 
Prometheans, before being stopped and imprisoned by the Librarian. The Librarian, who has guided humanity's development, accelerates 
the Chief's evolution to grant him immunity to the Composer.

<h3><b>Halo 5: Guardians</b></h3>
<img src="halo5.jpg"alt="Halo 5: Guardians"style="width: 200px;height: 200px;">
<p>Fireteam Osiris is deployed to the planet of Kamchatka, occupied by Jul 'Mdama's splinter Covenant faction, to retrieve the rogue 
Dr. Halsey and her intel amidst a battle between Covenant forces and the Prometheans. Halsey claims to have information on a series 
of devastating attacks on several human worlds. While the team is successful in retrieving Halsey and eliminating the Covenant faction's 
leader Jul 'Mdama, Halsey informs them that a new threat is about to emerge.

Elsewhere, the Master Chief leads Blue Team on a mission to secure a derelict ONI research station known as Argent Moon. The arrival of 
Jul 'Mdama's Covenant fleet forces Blue Team to scuttle the station instead. During the sabotage, the Chief receives a cryptic message 
from Cortana, directing him to the planet Meridian. John is ordered to return to Infinity upon destroying Argent Moon, but he and Blue 
Team disobey orders and set out after Cortana, forcing Captain Lasky to list the rogue Spartans as AWOL. This causes consternation aboard 
Infinity, as Halsey believes that Cortana's survival through the use of Forerunner technology makes her unpredictable and untrustworthy.

<h3><b>Halo Infinite</b></h3>
<img src="haloinfinite.jpg"alt="Halo Infinite"style="width: 200px;height: 200px;">
<p>
One year after the events of Halo 5: Guardians, the UNSC Infinity is attacked by the Banished, a faction of former Covenant species led by 
the warlord Atriox. Atriox quickly defeats the Master Chief and hurls him into space as the Infinity is destroyed by the Banished. Six months later, 
a UNSC pilot code-named Echo 216 discovers the Chief adrift in space and brings him into his Pelican dropship, restoring power to his armor. 
The Chief and Echo-216 travel to the nearby surface of Zeta Halo (Installation 07), one of the seven installations of the Halo Array, which has been 
severely damaged and fragmented by an unknown calamity. On the surface of the ring, the Chief locates the Weapon, an artificial intelligence designed 
to imitate Cortana to capture her for deletion. While the Weapon states that she was successful in her mission, she has failed to self-delete per her 
programming, for unknown reasons. The Chief retrieves the Weapon, and begins to experience visions of Cortana's memories and thoughts, which the Weapon 
explains are “dust and echoes” lingering after Cortana's death.

The Chief discovers that Zeta Halo has been completely taken over by the Banished, now led by Atriox's lieutenant Escharum after Atriox's apparent death. 
The Chief, the Weapon, and a reluctant Echo-216 begin rallying scattered UNSC forces on the ring's surface to fight back against the Banished and prevent 
them from controlling Zeta Halo. The Chief learns that the Banished have excavated a Forerunner facility known of the Conservatory, inside of which the 
Chief encounters 117649 Despondent Pyre, the Monitor of Zeta Halo. Despondent Pyre attempts to warn the Chief of a threat contained on the installation, 
but is subsequently destroyed by the Harbinger, an alien being reawakened by the Banished upon their arrival on Zeta Halo. The Harbinger claims that her people, 
the Endless, survived the firing of the Halo Array but were subsequently imprisoned by the Forerunners on Zeta Halo. She has allied herself with the Banished in 
order to rebuild the Silent Auditorium, a facility which will allow her to free the Endless.
